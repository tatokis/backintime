## Main Toolbar

![take_snapshot](_images/document-save_btn.svg) Take Snapshot

Take a new Snapshot in background. The main window can be closed during taking the snapshot. Normal behavior is to only compare files size and modification time. Alternatively, you can take a new Snapshot with `checksums` option enabled. This will calculate checksums for every file to decide if the file has changed. Taking a snapshot with checksums option takes a lot more time but it will make sure, the destination files won't be corrupt.

Refresh the Snapshots in [Timeline](#timeline).

![snapshot_name](_images/gtk-edit_btn.svg) Snapshot Name

## Timeline

The Timeline lists all Snapshots which where already taken. You can browse them to see its contents in right hand [Files View](#files-view). The first item `Now` is not a Snapshot. It is a live view on the local file-system. It shows exact the same as your normal file browser. Multi selection is possible to remove multiple Snapshots altogether.

## Files View

Depending on selection in left hand [Timeline](#timeline) this will either show the original files or the files in the selected snapshot. You can jump directly to your home or include folders in `Shortcuts`.

## Statusbar

Show current status. While a snapshot is running this will show a progress-bar combined with current speed, already transferred data and the last message from `rsync`.
